Using HTML and CSS skills developed during initial modules in the Code Institute Full Stack Development course, build a static website for a band.

The band is a 1960â€™s rock band and have around 50 years experience of performing live at numerous events around the world.
Their primary target audiences are their fans and potential fans who wish to use the site to see and hear clips from their back catalog, and any new material as it becomes available.
Also, the band would like to use the site to showcase their music and publicise their availability to perform at events such as weddings and Christmas parties.
The band provided photos, video clips and audio clips to use in the website.

The band is The Monkees

Site Layout
---------------
The site has 4 pages *index.html*, *media.html*, *about.html* and *bookings.html*. A tabaular navigation bar is common through out to go between the the pages, the footer is also common and gives links to the bands social media presence.

*__index.html__* is the home page. Containing the most important information to both the user and the band - ticket sales and the hit song.

*__media.html__* provides the user with two additional songs via an audio player, with the lyrics under for their singalong pleasure.
