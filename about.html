                  <p class="lead">The Monkees were an American rock and pop band originally active between 1966 and 1971, with reunion albums and tours in the decades that followed. They were formed in Los Angeles in 1965 by Bob Rafelson and Bert Schneider for the American television series The Monkees which aired from 1966 to 1968. The musical acting quartet was composed of Americans Micky Dolenz, Michael Nesmith, and Peter Tork; and British actor and singer Davy Jones. The band's music was initially supervised by producer Don Kirshner, backed by the songwriting duo of Tommy Boyce and Bobby Hart.

He aspired to be the policeman in the hit show Heartbeat but was told he was too good looking for British T.V. <br>Jones quickly realised that as a singer on radio he had a chance to make it as his voice wasn't so brillient that the nation would be jealous. After a hit with Colpix, he was flown directly the studios in the U.S. to be the lead in the Monkees.

After college he was the front man of his own rock group "Micky and the One-Nighters" covering all the hits of the 60's. <br> After the Monkees Mick, or Mad Dawg as he now prefers to be called, grew a pink mow-hawk and continues to play drums in the trash-punk band "The Flaming Nipples".

His poetry was so inspiring that it only took one verse "Please Keep Me Home" to secure a General Education Diploma and an honorable discharge from the army. Nesmith continues to play folk festivals across the world for free.

US) got his big break with The Monkees because his good friend Stephen Stills teeth were too ugly. Pete is the oldest and most musically talented of the group and so was nicknamed Pops by the rest  of the boys.<br>After The Monkees Pete spent the next 5 years composing the soundtrack of Easy Rider, which he recorded as one single 2 hours and 5 mins track.
